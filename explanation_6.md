# Max and Min in an Unsorted Array
## Problem description
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in 
O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

## Solution
Assume the max and min in the array is the first element. Then compare each other element with max and min and 
meanwhile update them.

## Time complexity
Since the array is traversed only once, the time complexity is in the order of O(n).

## Space complexity
Space complexity is O(1).
